# Yield Farming

Guys, please **do your own research** on Liquidity yield farming on Pancakeswap or MDEX docs, there are so many material to read, we simply can't copy-paste everything here. The only thing we may need to mention is that we will **dynamically** choose the highest farming pair to the pool with least fees. If you don't know this part, better not participate in the genesis farming, just **bite** the "Onions" in salad plate which is well prepared with **less and less supply** all along the way.

## Native Farming

OnionFarm is a multi-asset **staking** **platform** for users to participate in validating the respective chain, while at the same time freeing the value locked in it. This is done by issuing a BEP20\(Later Bridged to HRC20\) **liquid derivative token** representing the staked token's value on the Binance Smart Chain.

Liquid token will be represented with an "**o**" infront of their ticker \(i.e **HT** -&gt; **oHT or HT** -&gt; **oHT**\)

OnionBank Token will be represented with the ticker symbol "**OFT**"

Onion Finance **Farming** is a cross-chain **native** crypto assets **staking platform** for users to participate in validating & saving on the respective chain, while freeing the value locked in it. This is done by issuing a BEP20/ERC20/HRC20 **liquid derivative token** representing the staked token's value on the respective chain like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain or Huobi Eco Chain.

Liquid token will be represented with an "**o**" infront of their usual ticker \(i.e **BNB** -&gt; **oBNB**\)

Onion Token will be represented with the ticker symbol "**OFT**"

The main feature allows users to use these ðŸŒŠ liquid tokens to gain ðŸ’¸ **extra yields %** by using these Liquid tokens to participate in **liquidity pools** or generate interest in the **lending/borrowing/Lottery** markets.

On top of maximizing yields, different assets will have other different features that benefit the stakers of different chains.BSC Bite Pool

_Taste the sweet and mild with a slight **bite** yields on top of all kinds of "Onion Recipes" on Onion.Finance!!_

### BNB Validator staking:

**Bite** the sweet sizzling juicy yields on top of the well sliced "onions" !!

* Average yield is 60% last year provided by Binance data
* Dynamic yield maximizing across multiple validators
* High validator rewards backed by BSC high transaction volume and rich eco system
* Safe staking fully controlled by **Validators Contract**, no loss of stake even if the validator is jailed 
* Binance chain **standard** unstaking time - **7 days**

The project will start with BNB on BSC network naming "Bite Pool" , before expanding into other BSC assets with farming/lending.

One of our main advantage would be **early redeemption policy**:

## HECO Tinder Pool

{% hint style="info" %}
_The project will start with BNB for a start, before expanding into other assets. The main reason is that Heco Node Election is not completed yet._
{% endhint %}

* Miners pledge HT to become one of the 21 validator nodes or 11 backup nodes
* stakers delegate their HT to Miners and share 70%~100%% Miner rewards
* Dynamic yield maximizing across multiple validators
* Easy unstaking by sending  an unstake transaction to the **Validators Contract** and only wait for 86400 blocks to withdraw all staked assets

### ETH Specific features

i.e. for Ether staking:

* Dynamic yield maximizing across multiple validators
* Early unlock from staking
* ETH 2.0 POS
* So many ether hodlers sleeping in those saving scheme or in exchanges

The project will start with BNB on BSC network in a short while after product goes live, before expanding into other BSC assets with mining/lending
