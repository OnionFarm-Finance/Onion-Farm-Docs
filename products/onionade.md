You will get two delicious flavors of ONF-ONF Onionade Pool to choose from: Auto-compounding

### What’s special about “Auto OFT Pool”? <a id="docs-internal-guid-c4c16237-7fff-3c33-3a56-18ccd8853f86"></a>

**you can simply stake your ONF tokens to earn more ONF tokens**

**Auto OFT**

* Stake your OFT and forget about it! The OFT you stake in this Onionade Pool will be automatically compounded \(reinvested\) daily for you, minus a small fee.
* The “automatic” compounding function is triggered by other users who get a small bounty for triggering it.
* Interest is displayed as APY, which includes compounding.
* A small performance fee is subtracted from your earnings each time the pool is automatically compounded. See below.
* An unstaking fee\(OFT\) applies when you unstake within 3 days of manually staking

### What are the fees for the Auto OFT Onionade Pool?

**Deposit fee**

* **None**

**Unstaking fee**

* **1% if you unstake \(withdraw\) within 72 hours.**
* After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more OFT in the pool.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

**Performance fee**

* **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
* For example, if the harvest was 1 ONF, then 0.02 ONF would be subtracted as the performance fee.

{% hint style="info" %}
The ONF collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee is **burned every week** as part of the regular ONF token burns.

This is a good thing for ONF holders because it reduces the overall amount of OFT tokens in existence, which helps reduce inflation.
{% endhint %}

### What's the best way to use the Auto ONF Onionade Pool? <a id="docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520"></a>

Simple: stake your ONF, but only withdraw after 72 hours \(if you need to\). This way you only pay the performance fee, and not the unstaking fee.

### What’s the Auto ONF bounty?

**Auto ONF Bounty: 0.05% of all Auto ONF pool users’ pending yield**

This bounty is given as a reward for providing a service to other users.

Whenever you successfully claim the bounty, you’re also helping out by activating the Auto ONF Pool’s compounding function for everyone.

Make sure the amount of ONF you receive will be greater than the HT or BNB fees you’ll spend to submit the blockchain transaction!
