# Bug Bounty

The Onion.Finance bug bounty program is focused around our smart contracts, websites, and apps with a primary interest in the prevention of loss of user funds, either by direct draining of locked funds or social engineering attacks by redirecting users or forcing them to sign a transaction.



**Smart Contracts and Blockchain**\*

| Level |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Critical | up to USD $100,000 |
| High | USD $10,000 |
| Medium | USD $2,000 |
| Low | USD $1,000 |

\*All bug reports must include a Proof of Concept demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited to be eligible for a reward. This may be a smart contract itself or a transaction.

**Website and Apps**

| Level |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Critical\* | USD $3,500 |
| High | USD $2,000 |
| Medium | USD $1,000 |

All payouts are done by the **Onion.Finance** team and are pegged to the **USD** values set here and are payable in **OFT**, **HT** or **BNB**.
