# Onion Farm Finance 项目简介

## 简介

SteakBank is a multi-asset **staking & Lottery** **platform** for users to participate in validating the respective chain, while at the same time freeing the value locked in it and participate in Lottery pool to win more. This is done by issuing a BEP20 **liquid derivative token** representing the staked token's value on the Binance Smart Chain.

Liquid token will be represented with an "o" infront of their usual ticker \(i.e **BNB** -&gt; **oBNB**\)

The main feature allows users to use these 🌊 liquid tokens to gain 💸 **extra yields %** by using these Liquid tokens to participate in **liquidity pools** or **lending/borrowing/Lottery** markets.

On top of maximizing yields, different assets will have other different features that benefit the stakers of different chains.
