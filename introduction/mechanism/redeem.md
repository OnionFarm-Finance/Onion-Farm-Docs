# Redeem

### Redeeming HT or BNB

üìç User who holds oBNB or oHT will be able to redeem HT and BNB, according to the Total LBNB/BNB ratio.  


{% hint style="info" %}
The unbonding process of BNB is a fixed 7 days for direct Binance Chain\(BC\) Validators.

HT Validator unstaking process should be more or less the same
{% endhint %}

As the number of users grows, the probability of earlier unstake will be higher and faster. This is because the ability for early unstake works in the way whereby newcomers who would like to stake, could net off the amount of BNB that users would like to unstake.

For example:   
_If there is a user A looking to stake 100 HT, and another user B looking to unstake 70 HT, then all 70 HT can be unstake in a day._

_However, if it is the other way round, with user A looking to stake 70 HT, and user B wanting to unlock 100 HT, 70 HT can be unstaked in a day but the 30 BNB will be queued up._

_When multiple users try to unstake during a period, all the prior pending unstakes will have been fulfilled, before fulfilling the current one. Volunteers in our community will be in charge of claiming all ‚Äúmature unstakes‚Äù. Users don't need to do anything and their unstaked HT will be paid to their wallets automatically._
