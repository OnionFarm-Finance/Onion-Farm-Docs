# Tracking Rewards

## Tracking staking rewards given out each day

Heco Chain Rewards tracking **would be released soon**. This is a guide for users to check the **BSC staking** **rewards** distributed daily.  
  
For the start, click on the BSC explorer link

**BSC explorer**: [https://bscscan.com/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001000\#events](https://bscscan.com/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001000#events)

**Event Hash**: 0xa217d08e65f80c73121cd9db834d81652d544bfbf452f6d04922b16c90a37b70  
  
It will filter through the event hash `batchTransfer(uint256 amount)`

You will then see the latest events, and each event shows the sum of all validator rewards in a day, where each day, all the validator rewards will be transferred back to BC \(Binance Chain\).

As per the example shown, change the "Hex" format into "Num" format.  
So for the block height of \#6145297, 4,411.43 BNB is being distributed as rewards.
