# Minting

## Minting oHT or oBNB

üìç **Value** of stake BNB == **Value** of minted oHT or oBNB

The genesis amount of BNB staked will mint the equivalent amount of LBNB as rewards from the nodes have yet to accrue. However, as rewards from validating start to accrue, there would be more BNB vs oBNB. Therefore, the ratio of BNB:oBNB will go up, and minting 1 oBNB will cost more BNB.

üìç The **amount** of oBNB minted upon staking BNB tokens will be equal to the current ratio of LBNB/BNB ratio.

For example:  
There are 1001 BNB staked in the Pool, and 1000 oBNB minted. If the user were to mint 1 BNB, he would be receiving 1000/1001 = 0.9990 LBNB. Similarly, when redeeming BNB from 1oBNB, it would be a similar reverse process based on the ratio of BNB to oBNB. All things being equal, BNB will always be increasing a few percentage due to the accumulating of yield when staking, and the price of LBNB will generally be at a premium of BNB.
